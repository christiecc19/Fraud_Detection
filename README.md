# Fraud_Detection
This project developed a model to predict whether a new user's account is fraudulent

Explored the dataset by using visualization tools Seaborn/Matplotlib.

Handled imbalanced data by using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique(SMOTE).  

Extracted a few new features, pre-processed categorical features by using one hot encoding technique. 

Trained the model by applying  Logistic Regression, Random Forest to predict whether the activity of a new user is fraudulent.

Tuned  the hyperparameters by using  Grid Search ,identified the top 3 factors to detect fraud. 

Dataset:IpAddress_to_Country.csv, imbalancedFraudDF.csv

Code: fraud_detection.ipynb.
